679483385,"My mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and I was her chauffeur for the day. The lobby is really nice, as is all their locations in the Southwest that I've been to, due to recent renovations. Very modern, classy, and extremely clean. This location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the Las Vegas Strip on the glass separating the restaurant from Terrible's convenience store. The new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read. I don't really eat at McDonald's, so I can't say much about the food. What I do usually order and enjoy was their Vanilla Cone. Delicious non-fat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone. The best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the Vanilla Cone at just $0.49 ($0.53 after sales tax)!! What an awesome deal! Especially when franchised locations charge $1 and up.So, based on the nice, welcoming lobby and consistently delicious Cone, I have no complaints. BONUS: Free Wi-Fi and the lobby and drive-thru are open 24 hours!"
679483735,ScaryMcDs,"This is not a family-friendly location. There's ALWAYS a crowd of undesirables hanging outside, and even inside. The police are always circling around, sometimes 2-3 police cars at once. I also witnessed an older gentleman pick up who I believe to have been a prostitute. He pulled up shortly after I did. I sat in the car for a while handling business on the phone. He stayed in his car. After a while, a young man exited with a woman dressed ""differently"" and watched her walk over to his car. They drove away together. I decided it was time to go..."
679484306,I love this McDonalds! The workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk into the door! The first time I walked into this store I was shocked! The store has chandeliers and antiques and art on the walls. It looks more like a five star restaurant that a fast food joint! The bathrooms even have gold plated fixtures!It's still McDonalds so the food is the same as everywhere else but the employees and atmosphere makes it a pleasant experience.
679484693,Really rude workers and customer service was just overall horrible. The biscuits were hard as rock and their sausages seem to have been cooked hours before I bought it. Avoid this place if possible.
679485181,"WORST MCDONALDS EVER!Every single time we have been to this McDonalds on Southern Highlands Parkway we ask for our burgers and fries to be made up fresh. ξThey never are, in fact, they are cold and the buns are cold as well. ξStep it up McDonalds! ξYour reviews are bad and this is the Manager's fault!"
679492436,"Worst service ever!!!! There was so much trash everywhere and the lady at the cashier didn't even give me and my family water cups. And on top of that, she got our order wrong. I wish i could give negative stars because this mc donalds was horrible. There was so much trash lying around, my family and I almost left."
679494190,"Normally I don't review a chain unless something about that particular location stands out, good or bad.This location for some reason, has the most ridiculous service I've ever encountered. ξIt's McDonalds you say, what do you expect? ξNot much, really but let me tell you...ENCOUNTER #1I ordered 10-piece chicken nuggets, fries, and unsweetened ice tea. ξI got the nuggets and tea. ξI went up to the counter, placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me, and said ""I'm sorry, I --"" ξBefore I finished my sentence, the employee SLAMMED her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her. ξUm... WTF?!I didn't know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me. ξI went ""um...ok..."" and backed away from the counter to fill my tea. ξI have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me, asked me what the heck happened. ξI said ""I have no clue, I'm just missing my fries..."" ξMy friend was nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter, grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you? ξI'm SORRY you were having a bad day but that doesn't excuse you from taking it out on a customer who was trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed. ξNot a big deal, I paid for fries and I have an incomplete order. ξSo chill, geez.---------ENCOUNTER #23 friends and I came here for smoothies. ξOne of my friends ordered a big mac, nuggets and fries. ξEveryone else got our orders. ξMy friend waited 20 minutes for his order to be done. ξNo lie, we looked at the time on the receipt.You're thinking, um yea maybe they were cooking it. ξNo...In that 20 minutes, we saw 5 employees goofing off, bickering with each other, throwing towels at each other, and basically... being extremely unprofessional. ξThey didn't even do this in the back were customers cant see, they did this all in front of us, just on the other side of the counter. ξBased on the manager's asking where the order is, they seem to have forgotten about the order.I don't care if you do this at work, but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food? ξIt's really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off AND have your manager ask the team where our order is... THREE times.I really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check. ξFor his credit, he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choice...which honestly is nothing because I dont ever order a pie, cone, or sundae.oh and our smoothies were not filled all the way to the top... ξmine was 75% full."
679494608,Every time I come here they mess up my order....I NEVER leave the drive thru window before checking any more....
679495317,"Don't go here if you're looking for fast food. They're fast to take your order, but that's where it ends."
679495463,"Ok ok ok, I know it's only a McDonald's, BUT this one is completely different in decor. It's big, clean, bright and pretty. With tons of flat screens all over the place. Another big plus to this McDonald's is that they've got free Wi-Fi (while most hotels charge ridiculous fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries.Even though it's smack dab on the strip, there's plenty of parking too!"
679495976,"Okay so I came in here yesterday around 4:15 P.M. I took a while trying to make up my mind. ξI had seen a commercial about the mozzarella sticks. SO I thought I would try that, a ξMcDouble and a medium French fries. When I ordered I started with the mozzarella sticks. ξThe cashier thought I said chicken McNuggets. ξI corrected her and said the mozzarella sticks. ξThen I also ordered the McDouble and the medium French fries. ξMy order was rung up and I got my order withing 5 minutes. That's good. ξBad- I can't for the life of me find where the salt, pepper and ketchup is on the first floor. If they have it on the second floor I don't remember. I was in a rush to get home so I grabbed my food and went to wait for the subway. I looked in the bag and was surprised at what I saw. ξIn my bag was a medium order of French fries, 4 chicken McNuggets, a McDouble, and a pack of marinara sauce. ξI used the marinara sauce for the chicken. However, in what language does mozzarella sticks sound like chicken McNuggets? ξAnd I wonder what the price difference was between the mozzarella sticks and 4 piece chicken McNuggets.I already swiped my Metrocard so it wasn't worth it to complain."
679497650,"The drive thru got our order wrong AGAIN. I called the manager who argued with me about what was ordered. I had to ask her if she cared or was even going to help me. She just continued to argue that the drive thru entered what was ordered, yelling at me and interrupting me as I told her repeatedly they took the order wrong and this is not the first time this has happened. After asking if she was going to be of help, she refused, saying to call back tomorrow to talk to someone else and hung up on me. Just because an employee here doesn't have to be an intelligent person doesn't mean they can be rude. I'm sure she is smarter than a dog and even dogs know how to be polite."
679499048,"Breakfast for the family and kids. ξ8 of us. ξMessed up the whole order. ξMissing hot cakes, missing eggs, missing yogurt parfait, four napkins, four ketchups...1 star.BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A MACDONALDs IN VEGAS!"
679499432,"If I could put zero stars, it would deserve that. Rude rude rude manager. The worst McDonalds I have EVER been to. They forced me to buy a LARGE MEAL when I only wanted chicken nuggets. How is that legal??! You can't refuse to serve what I order because you just want to make more money. WORSE. PLACE. EVER. Calling to complain. What a scheme."
679500008,I enjoyed the part where I repeatedly asked if I had the right sauce 4 times...then didn't. Fuck you McDonalds.
679500224,"Worst McDonalds I've been in in a long time! Dirt everywhere, food barely warmand slow service. Needs a manager!"
679500608,"When I am really craving for McDonald's, this seems to be the closest. But I'm no big fan of fast food chains.I don't like this location just because there are bums inside waiting for the bus to go to Atlantic City or whatever...they usually sit and chat and drink some coffee. Same food as any other McDonald's & waitresses are friendly!"
679501257,"Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald's and McDonald's food isn't really an essential service; people generally know what they're getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald's had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn't just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood."" Really? Since when does being authentically ""black"" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it's mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. And youth thugs (of any race) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the ""Wild mid-West."" Just a thought, Rahm - do what you want with it."
679501402,"I wanted to grab breakfast one morning before work since it's just across the street, but the restaurant was filled with homeless people! It's like their hangout spot... I waited a lot longer than I needed to just to order. If they didn't have bums loitering around, maybe would have added one more star. The staff is not the problem, they look like they actually have to deal with a lot if problematic people. They should focus on making the place a little pleasant for their guest. No one wants to eat their burger while having to endure the smell if urine lingering off a homeless person."
